# music memory game
## Simple memory game to help children differentiate between musical pitches

I plan to use Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and SCSS to create a game based on the traditional card-turning memory game. This will stand out from the crowd by being aimed at music teachers and parents who can use this game to help their students/children to develop their musical ear.

Each card will have a corresponding musical 'tone' that will play. In 'easy' mode the cards/notes will also have a colour assigned to them. At 'harder' level the notes will all appear the same, leaving the child to remember only the difference in pitches.
